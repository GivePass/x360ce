Google Code Project page: http://code.google.com/p/x360ce

History:

13/12/2010 - version 3.3.1.368
Rename FakeAPI to InputHook - rename ini section "FakeAPI" to "InputHook", and key "FakeMode" to "HookMode".
Use EasyHook insted of MS Deutors
Add x64 build.
Return ERROR_EMPTY insted of ERROR_SUCCESS in XInputGetKeystroke - fixes Shank.
Log to console window ("Console" key in "Options" section)
Fixed memory leak when Log is enabled.
Many other small fixes.

16/08/2010 - version 3.2.0.246
CrazyCat added FakeWMI CoUninitialize (fixes HAWX 1.02!)

15/08/2010 - version 3.2.0.241
Separete ANSI and UNICODE FakeDI functions.
XInputGetCapabilities will (hopefully) now return proper data, and should be little faster.
WriteLog optimization (but for gaming set it alyways to 0, it's just little faster...).
LeftMotorPeriod & RightMotorPeriod to manipulate FFB Period values (in milisecounds).

11/08/2010 - version 3.2.0.184
Marged FakeWMI & FakeDI to FakeMode:
	0 - Disabled
	1 - Normal mode,game will detect gamepad as xinput compatibilie device.
	2 - Compatbility mode, game will detect gamepad as XBOX 360 Controler for Windows.

10/08/2010 - version 3.2.0.171
crazycat fix main FakeDI problems by temporary disabling it for enumeration inside x360ce dll so FakeDI=2 will not break x360ce enumeration ! (BIG thanks for that, the idea was so simple ...).
So I disabled magic checks in FakeEnumCallback that are ussles now (because above change) and add check for FakeDI inside FakeGetProperty.
FakeWMI_NOPIDVID was removed, insted FakeWMI will check for FakeDI setting because only usefull settings are:
	FakeWMI=1, FakeDI=0 -> FakeWMI will add only IG_ string
	FakeWMI=1, FakeDI>0 -> FakeWMI will add IG_ string and change VID/PID to Fake ones
	With this method is easier to configure x360ce (do not add any new options).
	Most games will work now with: FakeWMI=1, FakeDI=0. Some (mostly Ubisoft games) will need FakeWMI=1, and FakeDI>0 (game depended, but 2 should be safe for now).
Pre 3.1.4.0 history deleted from this file.

08/08/2010 - version 3.2.0.164
ejocys writhed new FFB implemetation ! This fix many FFB problems !
crazycat fixed XInputGetCapatibilities.
I added some FakeAPI chages: FakeDI=3 - blocker, as old dinput8.dll blocker, 
	it will block all devices accept mouse and keyboard.
New FakeAPI option FakeWMI_NOPIDVID, to add only IG_ string in WMI, Prototype and POPFS 
	now playble with FFB on settings: FakeWMI=1, FakeWMI_NOPIDVID=1, FakeDI=0.

22/04/2010 - version 3.2.0.91
Change build enviroment to Visual Studio 2010.
Build with Detours library from MPC-HC (should be better, but force compiling with static runtime).
Added Unicode/ANSI detection to FakeDI Callback.
Proper handling XInputGetCapabilities.
Some changes in ini options.
Many minor changes, and some code cleanup.
Automatic version system based on SVN revision (major.minor.patch.svn_revision).
